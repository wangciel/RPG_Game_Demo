Knave
=======

## Overview
Knave is a 2D metroidvania game in which the key objective is to escape the 
castle by collecting objects and avoiding enemies and obstacles.

The idea of the game is that the player is stuck in the bottom of a dungeon in 
a castle and the goal of the game is to navigate through the area to try 
and escape. This is done by collecting keys off the ground and stealing them 
from guards. These keys help with opening opening doors and unlocking chests. 
Along the way, the player will find lots of collectables such as power ups and 
health potions which the player can use to their advantage to complete the game.

## Instructions
* Use WAD or arrows keys to move the player, space and up arrow key to jump.
* F to interact with doors and chests.
* Left shift to dash.
* H to use the health poison.
* C to push and pull wood crates and barrels.
* Esc to pause.
