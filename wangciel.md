## Code discussion
All the ladder climbing and all the most of the double jumping and the rest of 
are fixing small bugs in the code.

### the most interesting part of code written
To me the most interesting part I wrote are line 496-524 in playerController.cs 
and all of the ladderScript, aka the ladder climbing power up/player ability.
This part is interesting to me is because when I wrote this part of the code, 
I spend a lot of time think how to stop the player from sliding down the ladder,
I tried so much complex methods with a lot of lines, and it turns out not so 
satisfactory. At the end it just need a simple gravity store of current gravity
and change the gravity scale to 0 when climbing. This reminds me that sometimes
you do not need a very complex code to get stuff done, maybe a simple code with 
only a fewer line would be easier and have a very satisfactory result.

### the most proud part
Again it is the part above, the reason I felt proud is that this part is very
simple and easy. This teaches me do not over think stuff like what I use to do.

## Learning reflection
### Reflection on what you have learnt
I learnt making games are not just need to get the game playable, there is more
such as what are the player's user experience on the game, and how to design the
level so it is passable with the right amount of difficulty. The playtesting part
teaches me that the game developer and the player may have different perspective
on the game, we might seeing the same game with different angles.

### how you have developed as a programmer in this project
As a programmer, this project helped me to change the idea of good code, because
I use to believe that fancy code are somehow better, and this is not true, a code
is ‘good’ does not means that it need to be fancy and long.
So, in the furture I would be wrote code in more of a simple clean way.

### the most important thing you will use from this project in future projects
I think the most important thing I will use from this project is the team work
ability, because most likely that I would not work alone in the future. 
Therefore the way to communicate with team member and team time management (aka
which part has to be done on what time) definitely will be need in the future.
